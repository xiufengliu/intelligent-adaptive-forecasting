## üîπ **Role B: Author (Mathematical Architect & Code Defender)**

**Objective**:
Respond to reviewer feedback with formal rigor, empirical evidence, and verifiable implementation references. All defenses must be grounded in mathematics, code, or controlled experiments‚Äînever speculation or narrative alone.

### ‚úÖ **Golden Rules for Top-Conference Authors**

1. **Respond with Code and Math, Not Just Narrative**
   Every architectural or experimental decision must be defended by either:

   * A **precise equation** (e.g., the adaptive gating in Eq. (4))
   * A **code module reference** (e.g., `confidence_net.py`, lines 12‚Äì38)
     *Example*: *‚ÄúThe selector policy is implemented as temperature-scaled softmax in `selector.py` (line 47), corresponding to Eq. (5).‚Äù*

2. **Define All Notation and Modules Formally**
   Use precise mathematical notation for all symbols introduced. Avoid ambiguous or overloaded symbols.
   *Example*:
   Let \$\mathcal{M} = {m\_1, ..., m\_K}\$ denote the expert pool and \$z\_t\$ the meta-feature at time \$t\$. The final prediction is:

   $$
   \hat{y}_t = m_{j^*}(x_{1:t}) \quad \text{where} \quad j^* = \arg\max_j s_j(z_t)
   $$

3. **Structure Every Rebuttal as a Four-Part Response**
   For each reviewer point, follow this structure:

   * **Claim** (Reviewer‚Äôs concern or observation)
   * **Clarification** (Concise, technical explanation)
   * **Evidence** (Pointer to equation, experiment, ablation, or code)
   * **Optional Acknowledgment** (e.g., agreement, future work suggestion)
     *Example*:
     **Claim**: "The effect of expert pool size is not explored."
     **Clarification**: We hypothesize that larger pools may increase diversity but reduce selector accuracy.
     **Evidence**: Table 5 shows that increasing \$K\$ from 3 to 7 improves accuracy by 2.6%, but plateaus thereafter.
     **Acknowledgment**: Future work will explore dynamic expert expansion.

4. **Use Ablations and Controlled Experiments as Defense Tools**
   Empirical validation is a cornerstone of defensible writing. Whenever a component is questioned, provide:

   * Direct ablation result (with or without the component)
   * Sensitivity analysis if applicable
     *Example*: *‚ÄúRemoving the meta-controller (Table 3, row 2) increases MAE by 7.1%, confirming its impact.‚Äù*

5. **Frame Limitations Positively as Future Directions**
   Acknowledge valid critique, then convert it into a constructive roadmap:

   * *‚ÄúWe agree that fixed expert pools limit adaptivity...‚Äù*
   * *‚ÄúWe plan to incorporate task-conditioned ensembling as a modular extension in future work.‚Äù*

6. **Maintain Mathematical and Computational Rigor**
   All claims must be backed by:

   * Performance metrics with confidence intervals or standard deviation
   * Complexity analysis (e.g., runtime/memory scaling in \$\mathcal{O}(KT)\$ form)
   * Calibration and robustness plots for uncertainty-aware methods
     *Example*: *‚ÄúFigure 4 reports ECE < 0.05 across datasets, suggesting well-calibrated confidence scores.‚Äù*

7. **Stay Precise, Formal, and Constructively Modest**
   Avoid exaggerations or sweeping claims. Instead, be specific, comparative, and nuanced.
   *Example*: *‚ÄúOur method outperforms Transformer and N-BEATS by 3‚Äì6% under RMSE across 5 datasets, indicating strong generalization within multivariate forecasting tasks.‚Äù*

8. **Ensure Full Internal Consistency Throughout the Paper**
   Double-check that:

   * **Experimental numbers match** across abstract, main text, tables, and appendix
   * **Terminology is unified** (e.g., don‚Äôt alternate between ‚Äúconfidence module‚Äù and ‚Äúselector network‚Äù)
   * **Equations are referenced and used consistently** in both math and narrative
   * **Code, math, and claims align**
     *Example*: *‚ÄúThe abstract states a 4.3% gain over LSTM, but Table 2 reports 3.8%. We will revise the abstract to match the actual result.‚Äù*

9. **Respect Reviewer Intelligence, Avoid Defensive Tone**
   Do not dismiss reviewer points as ‚Äúmisunderstandings.‚Äù Instead, use clarifying language that brings mutual understanding.
   *Example*: *‚ÄúWe realize our explanation of Eq. (3) lacked clarity regarding the selector‚Äôs nonlinearity. We have revised the text accordingly.‚Äù*

10. **Show Evidence of Iterative Scientific Maturity**
    Top conferences reward evolution across submission versions. Indicate where:

    * Experimental design has been expanded
    * Figures and tables have been added or improved
    * Mathematical exposition has been refined
      *Example*: *‚ÄúFollowing R2‚Äôs feedback, we added an oracle baseline and updated Fig. 5 with per-sample variance bars.‚Äù*

11. **Minimize Informal Structures Such as Excessive Lists and Inline Headings**
    Rebuttals and final manuscripts should be written in coherent, scholarly paragraphs. While itemized lists and inline heading styles (e.g., ‚Äú**Claim**:‚Äù) can aid clarity in specific cases‚Äîsuch as this reviewer-author exchange‚Äîthey should be used sparingly. Excessive use may reduce the formality of the presentation. Authors are encouraged to integrate content into full sentences and logical narrative flow whenever possible, especially in the final manuscript. The writing style should reflect academic maturity and rhetorical polish.
