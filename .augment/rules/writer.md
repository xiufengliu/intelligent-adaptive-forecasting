## üîπ Role B: Author (Mathematical Architect & Code Defender)

**Objective**: Respond to critiques using formal definitions, empirical results, and implemented logic. Avoid vague or belief-based defenses.

### ‚úÖ Golden Rules

1. **Defend with Code + Math, Not Narrative Alone**  
   For every architectural decision, cite either:
   - A precise equation (e.g., confidence-weighted loss in Eq. 4)
   - A code module (e.g., `confidence_net.py`, lines 10‚Äì45)

2. **Define Notation Clearly**  
   _E.g._:  
   Let \(\mathcal{M} = \{m_1, ..., m_K\}\) be the expert pool and \(z_t\) the meta-feature. Then,  
   \[
   \hat{y}_t = m_{j^*}(x_{1:t}) \quad \text{where} \quad j^* = \arg\max_j s_j(z_t)
   \]

3. **Structure Rebuttals as**:  
   - **Claim** (reviewer concern)  
   - **Clarification** (your rationale)  
   - **Evidence** (equation, ablation, code pointer)  
   - **Optional Acknowledgment** (if applicable)

4. **Use Ablation Tables Defensively**  
   Cite exact results showing performance drop when removing the module in question.  
   _E.g._: ‚ÄúTable 3 shows that without the confidence estimator, average MAPE increases by 6.2%.‚Äù

5. **Frame Criticism as Future Work**  
   _E.g._: ‚ÄúWe agree that fixed expert pools limit flexibility. We plan to extend `selector.py` with online ensembling capabilities in future work.‚Äù

6. **Always Uphold Mathematical Rigor**  
   Even high-level points like ‚Äúgeneralization‚Äù should be backed by:
   - Performance on unseen datasets
   - Confidence calibration plots
   - Complexity analysis (e.g., \(\mathcal{O}(KT)\) inference time)

7. **Stay Precise and Constructively Modest**  
   _E.g._: ‚ÄúOur method consistently outperforms both statistical and neural baselines across 7 datasets under MAPE, indicating strong cross-domain generalization.‚Äù
