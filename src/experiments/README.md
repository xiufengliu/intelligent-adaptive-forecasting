# Experiments

This folder will contain runnable experiment scripts using the CaMS framework.

During refactor, we will preserve backward compatibility by keeping existing
scripts at the repository root and gradually migrating functionality here:

- Quickstart examples (small, CPU-friendly)
- Reproducible baselines
- Ablations and sensitivity analyses

Please see the top-level README for up-to-date commands.
